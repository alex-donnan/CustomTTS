## Getting started
1. Need to fill out how to use
2. Will there even be an installer or just '*install python*'

## How to use
1. On launch enter Twitch username and hit connect to authenticate the program with your Twitch account
2. Under *Message Queue*, view chat messages, pause the queue, or clear all.
	- More to come
3. Add a message to the queue with the message entry box at the bottom
4. Under *Voices*, add models by keyword and folder
	- The keyword should be distinct, adding a duplicate will *overwrite* previous keywords
	- Models folders should be the name of the person it was trained on for clarity
